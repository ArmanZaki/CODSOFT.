ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms.
Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud detection datasets, the model is carefully evaluated using multiple metrics beyond just accuracy, such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions, labeled as either:
  0 â†’ Non-Fraud
  1 â†’ Fraud
Dataset Source: Kaggle - [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

ðŸ“Š Model Workflow

Classification Report:
| Class | Precision | Recall  | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| 0     | 1.00      | 1.00    | 1.00     | 553574  |
| 1     | 0.97      | 0.21    | 0.34     | 2145    |

Macro Avg: Precision = 0.99 | Recall = 0.60 | F1 = 0.67  
Weighted Avg: Precision = 1.00 | Recall = 1.00 | F1 = 1.00
